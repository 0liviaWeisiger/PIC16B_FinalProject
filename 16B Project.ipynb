    "This project will explore the current United States real-estate market, investigate what factors influence the price of property, and create multiple machine learning models that predict these housing costs throughout the country. More specifically, this will be accomplished through implementation of (add briefly about what models we end up using....) Being able to infer and understand the trends of real estate is extremely valuable economic knowledge that will provide important insights about our country. \n",

By merging datasets, we will investigate which underlying factors such as (add briefly when choose other data) affect the prices of houses in order to draw deeper conclusions about intangible factors impacting our economic climate."

For example we would see that practically all samples from New York would fall in the upper portion of data, while a huge majority of samples from rural states will be in the lower. This would leave our model with very little to do, so to work around this we have decided to create a categorical column that contains a 1 if the property price is above the median housing price **of the state it is in**, and a 0 if the property is below this median average of its state. This takes out the state bias and may lead to more informative conclusions about other features that are no longer overshadowed.\n",

One caution to note is that our original real estate data is from the past two years, so we will need to make sure the data we are merging with is taken from the same time period in order to obtain accurate conclusions.\n",

As explained above, we are only interested in the 2021 data since our pricing data comes from recent years, so we will trim down our dataset accordingly. Additionally, the dataset comes with dozens of feature columns, but for our purposes we only need to keep the zip code column (which we will use to merge our original dataset), and the median household income column. So let's process our dataset and display the cleaner result."
