    "This project will explore the current United States real-estate market, investigate what factors influence the price of property, and create multiple machine learning models that predict these housing costs throughout the country. More specifically, this will be accomplished through implementation of (add briefly about what models we end up using....) Being able to infer and understand the trends of real estate is extremely valuable economic knowledge that will provide important insights about our country. \n",

By merging datasets, we will investigate which underlying factors such as (add briefly when choose other data) affect the prices of houses in order to draw deeper conclusions about intangible factors impacting our economic climate."

As explained above, we are only interested in the 2021 data since our pricing data comes from recent years, so we will trim down our dataset accordingly. Additionally, the dataset comes with dozens of feature columns, but for our purposes we only need to keep the zip code column (which we will use to merge our original dataset), and the median household income column. So let's process our dataset and display the cleaner result."
